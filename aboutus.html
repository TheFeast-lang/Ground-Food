        <p>Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #2, Zero Hunger, is a global initiative aimed at ending hunger 
            and malnutrition while promoting sustainable food systems. Its primary objectives are to ensure that all people,
             particularly the most vulnerable populations such as children, women, and marginalized communities, have access to 
             sufficient, nutritious, and affordable food throughout the year. This goal seeks to improve agricultural productivity and incomes, 
            especially for small-scale farmers, and ensure that food systems are resilient to the challenges posed by climate
             change, economic shocks, and other crises.</p>

             <p>The SDG also focuses on improving nutrition by promoting diverse, healthy diets, addressing the underlying
             causes of hunger, and reducing food waste. Key actions include enhancing the quality of food production, 
             promoting sustainable farming practices, investing in rural infrastructure, and empowering women and local
              communities to have a central role in food security. By achieving Zero Hunger, the world will contribute to broader 
              goals of reducing poverty, ensuring social equity, and promoting environmental sustainability.</p>
